1. HR View

Added HR as a super user, so now HR can create all user accounts (lecturers, coordinator, manager).

Implemented functionality to add and update user info, including hourly rates for lecturers.

Added the ability to generate reports showing submitted claims, approved claims, and total payments for the month. I used LINQ to pull the data and created a downloadable PDF.

Removed any self-registration — all users are now created and managed by HR.[PROG6212_POE.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23684947/PROG6212_POE.pptx)


2. Lecturer View

Added login functionality using Identity and sessions.

Auto-loaded lecturer info (name, surname, hourly rate) when submitting claims — they no longer need to type in their hourly rate.

Implemented auto-calculation of total payment based on hours worked.

Added validation: cannot submit more than 180 hours, cannot leave fields empty, and negative hours are not allowed.

Made it so lecturers can track their claims through the whole approval process with coordinator and manager.

3. Coordinator & Manager Views

Coordinator and Manager now have separate roles and dashboards.

Coordinator reviews lecturer claims and can approve, reject, or request changes.

Manager reviews claims approved by coordinator and can give final approval.

Added sessions and role-based access, so users cannot access pages they shouldn’t.

4. Claim Workflow & Automation

Claims now move through a workflow:

Lecturer submits → Pending

Coordinator approves → CoordinatorApproved

Manager approves → ManagerApproved

HR processes → Processed

Uploaded supporting documents are linked to each claim and can be viewed/downloaded by Coordinator and Manager.

5. Database / EF Core

Switched fully to MSSQL, using EF Core to store all data: users, claims, and documents.

Everything is persisted, so claims and reports are pulled directly from the database.

6. Documents

Consolidated document upload to work directly with claims.

Implemented file validation, only allowing PDF, JPEG, or PNG files, with a max size of 5MB.

Unique filenames are generated to avoid conflicts.

7. PowerPoint & Presentation

Created slides showing all the key features and improvements from Part 2 → Part 3.

Included screenshots of:

HR adding users

Lecturer submitting a claim

Auto-calculation and validation

Coordinator and Manager approval

Reports generated by HR

Focused on UI and workflows, not full code.

8. Version Control

Pushed all changes to GitHub with more than 10 commits, each with descriptive messages.

9. Summary

In Part 3, I basically made the system fully automated, role-based, and connected to a real database.
The workflow is now smoother, the UI is easier to navigate, and the system matches the requirements for HR, Lecturers, Coordinator, and Manager roles.
